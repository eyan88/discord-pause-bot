discord pokemon info bot

In order to apply concepts that I've learned, I wanted to create a simple Pokemon Discord Bot that would pull information from an API and display it in Discord; this was done using the following concepts and technologies:

> - JavaScript
> - Node.js
> - npm
> - Discord.js library
> - Discord API, PokeAPI
> - RESTful APIs, HTTP Requests
> - Heroku
